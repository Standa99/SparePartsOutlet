# SparePartsOutlet
ASP.net application that enables control of the flow of production materials and spare parts
## A General Description Of Outlet
The idea for this application arose some time ago, when I started with the Python language and for my former employer, as part of personal training in this language, I coded an application for data management of xlsx excel tables. The next step in easing the bureaucracy and general backoffice should have been the SparePartsOutlet application in the Django framework. I couldn't get to that at the time and decided to accelerate my career change with a bootcamp at Green Fox Academy.
